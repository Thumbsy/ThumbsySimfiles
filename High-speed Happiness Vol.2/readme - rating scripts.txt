fnr.exe - Find And Replace Tool
Used this wonderful tool so you can easily switch between DDRX and ITG ratings if you wish so.
Just double-click the .bat file of your choice and the script will do the rest.
A command prompt window will open and barf output, you can close it again with a button press when it's done.
Tested under Windows only.
