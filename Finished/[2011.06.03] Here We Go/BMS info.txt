Probably my hardest expert chart so far :]
I personally think the hard part is reading the arrows.
So you might need to play a few times or autoplay+assist tick to fully understand the rythm.

It turned out to be a bit of a gimmicky chart this time... So stay on your toes ;]

PLEASE leave feedback about my files, steps, this description and all other things I could improve on that concerns my simfiles :] thanks!

Enjoy!
