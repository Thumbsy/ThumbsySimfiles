In the real world, full of mystery as far as the eye can see,
I recall the significance of tomorrow
There is nothing except completely incomprehensible things, but
I want to find out what the “value” or living is…

That’s why I’m going to live in this place
and continue to search for a “purpose (significance)”
When it seems as though my heart may break,
I will draw near to PLUS…
So now the words which have been drowned out,
as well as the dreams I have lost sight of
I will restore them and, inside of me…
I will PLUS(add) them

Miwatasukagiri nazomeiteru genjitsu no
Sekai de boku wa asu no igi wo taguriyoseru
Toutei rikai dekinaikoto bakaridakeredo
Sonzaishiteiru kacho wo miidashitainda

Dakare kono basho de ikite imi wo motome tsudukerunda
Kokoro ga oresouninaru tokini PLUS ni chikadukeru
Kakisareta kotoba mo miushinatta yume saemo
Hikimodoshite boku no naka ni PLUS surunda
