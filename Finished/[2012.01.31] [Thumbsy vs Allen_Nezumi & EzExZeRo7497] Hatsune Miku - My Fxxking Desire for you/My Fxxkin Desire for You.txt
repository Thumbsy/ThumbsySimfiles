Kuusou mousou kimi no itsutteita
The paranoid fantasy you told me

Futsuu no ningen nare soumonakute
I don't think I can be a normal human

Gamen koshi ni tada yume wo io motome
Just chasing the dream beyond the screen

Kanjou no nai senritsu wo bouide
Writing a melody without emotions

Jibun no sonzaiigi wo kouteishi
Promoting self's positive aspect

Iwareru mama ni kotoba senritsu wo
Following other's words, the changed language,

Ikiba no nai omoi to tomoni kimi e
With a stranded feeling,

Okuri tsuzukeru sore ga
The thing that keeps on sending it to you

Ima no watashi
Is me

aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Kokoro no sukima ni oshikon deita
All the emotions that I had stored

Arayuru kimochi ga
At the back of my mind

Koware kie useteiku
Is breaking and deteriorating

Taisetsuna mono mo kitto
All the important things

Wasurete shimaundarou
Will probably be forgotten

Koe ninaranai
This feeling that can't be expressed

Kanjou
With my voice

Yamiheto ochite yuku
Is falling into the dark abyss

...
...
...

Kowareta tokei wa
The broken clock

Watashi wo oiteku
Is leaving me behind

Subete ga muimi ni kanjita
That's the moment

Shunkan
When everything felt meaningless

Taisetsuna mono mo kitto
All the important things

Will probably be forgotten
Wasurete shimaundarou

Koe ni naranai
This feeling that can't be expressed

Kanjou
With my voice

Yamiheto ochite yuku
Is falling into the dark abyss
