Trying out something new this time :]
My favourite speedcore track of all time! It even manages to incorporate some happy hardcore! Brilliant.

gameplay: soon...?

song: Squid vs Pantyhose
artist: m1dy vs M-Project
BPM: 90-360
special: BPM changes, stops, BG changes (shouldn't be too distracting)
duration: 2:25
quality: 320 kb/s
X-scale ratings: 6/9/12/15 (this is the first time I'm trying out X-rates estimates so let me know if something's really off)

Enjoy! :]
