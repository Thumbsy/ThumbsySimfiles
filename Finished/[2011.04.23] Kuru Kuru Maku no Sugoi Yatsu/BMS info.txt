Finally got around to finishing this up, been wanting to step this for a while now :D
One of supercell's lesser known songs I think, but it always cheers me up :]

The charts are quite easy this time... the Expert chart is very easy for a 7 I think and some parts in the Difficult chart are a little more complex than in the expert chart... what have I done... xD
But nonetheless I still enjoyed playing it.

song: くるくるまーくのすごいやつ (Kuru Kuru Maku no Sugoi Yatsu)
artist: supercell
BPM: 160
duration: 2:18
quality: 320 kb/s CBR (converted from FLAC file)

gameplay: http://youtu.be/9PKsDFpcr38

PLEASE leave feedback about my files, steps, this description and all other things I could improve on that concerns my simfiles :] thanks!

Enjoy!
