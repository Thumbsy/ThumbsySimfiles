Man I love this tune. Dougal & Gammer have given birth to some of my favourite UK Hardcore tunes out there :P

Trying out some new stuff this time. First of all, stops. No unnecessary gimmicky stops, I think these fit the music properly. And I've decided to include a Challenge chart this time. Not really sure if 11 is the right rating for it... time and comments will tell I guess ;]

song: Guitar Hero
artist: Dougal & Gammer
BPM: 170
special: stops, bg changes (might be distracting to some)
duration: 1:36
quality: 224 kb/s CBR

PLEASE leave feedback about my files, steps, this description and all other things I could improve on that concerns my simfiles :] thanks!

Enjoy!
