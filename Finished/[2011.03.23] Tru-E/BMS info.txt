Some nice UK Hardcore this time.
I have the feeling that the chart is a bit more boring than 「リア充爆発しろ！」 but I still enjoyed playing it so I hope you will too :] the expert chart is stuffed with basic crossovers since I felt they're fun and went alright with the music.

BPM: 177
duration: 1:49
quality: 224 kb/s CBR

PLEASE leave feedback about my files, steps, this description and all other things I could improve on that concerns my simfiles :] thanks!

Enjoy!
