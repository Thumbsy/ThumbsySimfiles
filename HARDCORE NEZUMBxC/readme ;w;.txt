I figured a DropBox folder for our little pack would be handy, everytime you're finished with or edit a chart or anything else, just copy+paste it in the .sm file in DropBox, don't replace the whole file :3
This DropBox folder will be the to-be-released pack :J

I'm going to rate all pad charts according to the DDR X scale

Pack will use .ogg for ITG2 arcade compatability
