After years of releasing single simfiles, most of them through collaborative packs, I've finally decided to start something of my own.
With no place to go for the future Happycore simfiles I wanted to create, it seemed like a good opportunity to start this little series of mini-packs.
Special thanks to NewbStepper (https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/user?userid=14022) for helping me by providing feedback on the DDR X ratings!
Hope you'll enjoy the charts as much as I do myself, thanks for playing!
